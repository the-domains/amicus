  â€œLook again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone
  you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who
  ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering,
  thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every
  hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
  civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother
  and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,
  every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
  saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust
  suspended in a sunbeam.
